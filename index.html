    <h1>Intro</h1>
    <p>This is a page to consign notes from the first lesson.</p>
    <h1>The Web</h1>
    <p>Client computers, connected to the internet, use a browser to retrieve html files from servers using the http protocol.  HTML files may also refer to other files such as image or video files.<br>This is actually quite straightforward.
    </p>
    <h1>Computers</h1>
    <p>Computers interpret simple instructions and follow them.  There is no magic or interpretation of what the administrator <i>meant</i> to do but what he <b>did</b> do.
    </p>
  <div style="color:red">
    <h1>Tags, Inline, Section</h1>
    <p>This is intentionaly red in as it is in a block (<i>div</i>) where the style has been set to that color.  <span style="color:black">however <i>a span</i> can be used to change inline characteristics of text.</span> Once out of the span, things get back to whatever is in the div.
    <p>Tags are really the things that define how things are layed out, how they look and where they should be on the page.  For more information on <a href="www.w3schools.com/default.asp">this interesting website</a>
